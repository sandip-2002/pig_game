            <h3>Rules:</h3>
            <li>
              Roll the dice: The current player has to roll the dice and then a
              random number will be generated. If current player gets any number
              other than 1 on the dice then that number will be added to the
              current score (initially the current score will be 0) and then the
              new score will be displayed under Current Score section. Note: If
              the current player gets 1 on the dice then the players will be
              switched i.e. the current player will become in-active and
              vice-versa.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hold: If the current player clicks on HOLD, then the Current Score
              will be added to the Total Score. When the active player clicks
              the Hold button then the total score is evaluated. If the Total
              Score >= 100 then the current player wins else the players are
              switched.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reset: All the scores are set to 0 and Player 1 is set as the
              starting player (current player).
